# ChilliPharmApp

# Task

ChilliPharm would like to offer Master Physiotherapists an offline viewing mode.  MPs would select the videos that they would like to view offline.  Whilst offline, they would be able to view the videos, mark as Reviewed and complete an online QC Report.  These changes would then sync with the system once back online. 

Note: The state of a video being reviewed is just a boolean true or false and a QC report can just be a set of input fields with labels ‘xyz’


# Approach
* React JS
  * due to its features to build single page applications very quickly and modules.
* BootStrap 4
  * for out of the box features such as styling and responsiveness.

# Instructions
Please run npm install in the app dir and then run the command: 
```
npm start
```

## Release
The build directory has the Production build ready to be deployed to a server
